adding a parameter for a query or mutation requires a lot of changes

added user page and loads all user reviews and created ReviewCard

updating cache is interesting. learned about refetchQueries, InMemoryCache, etc.
styled-components was causing a mismatch between server side and client side classnames, so i updated babel config to resolve this issue.
had to use a different star rating package since it wasn't being updated after editing
went through like 5 star rating packages to find one that was able to update after edit and handle half stars
finished updating cache after delete and edit mutations 
improved sign in flow - removed extra sign in button step
only self users can edit and delete their own reviews
