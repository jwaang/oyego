Next-auth providers is really quick and easy to set up

adding a parameter for a query or mutation requires a lot of changes
graphql errors are sometimes hard to debug took me forever to realize i had an incomplete gql statement
converted a long parameters to input type in schema
added user page and loads all user reviews and created ReviewCard
added edit and delete functionality to reviews

updating cache is interesting. learned about refetchQueries, InMemoryCache, etc.
styled-components was causing a mismatch between server side and client side classnames, so i updated babel config to resolve this issue.
had to use a different star rating package since it wasn't being updated after editing
went through like 5 star rating packages to find one that was able to update after edit and handle half stars
finished updating cache after delete and edit mutations 
improved sign in flow - removed extra sign in button step
only self users can edit and delete their own reviews

protecting routes with redirect
starting styling changes now

7/22/21
added bg waves and glassmorphism to login page 
after login, redirects user to /home page instead of login

added A LOT of styling to the home page 
clicking on name redirects to users profile page 
added show more / show less for long reviews
added the date for when the review was created 
button is a reusable component with different variants
problem: we store the users profile pic in db but the image url expires...
